# Robotics - drones

Simulation made in 2021 for robotics lecture in Kaunas University of Technology.  
  
In simulation there are 4 drones in a warehouse that randomly wander around and search for boxes on the ground.  
- **If the box is light:** a single drone can carry it to delivery point.  
- **If the box is heavy:** a drone sends a help signal and waits for other drones to come for help. After 4 drones have arrived they together deliver the box to delivery point.  

After all boxes are collected - all drones go back to their pads.
